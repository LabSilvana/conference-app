                    <P class="presentation-1">
                        Workplace culture doesn’t start with beanbags, foosball tables, or a beer fridge, and it<br>
                        doesn’t end with neckties, PCs, or big corporations. It’s the unwritten rules, behavior,<br>
                        beliefs, and the motivations that enable good work to get done, or it’s what stifles a<br>
                        workforce. For design to be most effective and for designers to feel valued, we need to<br>
                        work in a culture that embraces design and allows it to succeed.<br>
                        In Aaron’s session he will explore how to recognize the traits of organizations that *get*<br>
                        design, both large and small. He will share what those teams, departments, and<br>
                        companies have that others don’t, and more importantly, how to begin to change your<br>
                        own workplace’s culture. Once you’ve worked within a culture of design it’s almost<br>
                        impossible to imagine yourself anywhere else.

                    <P class="presentation-1">
                        Films succeed in evoking responses and engaging audiences only with a combination of<br>
                        well-written narrative and effective storytelling technique. It’s the filmmaker’s job to<br>
                        put this together. To do so they’ve developed processes, tools and techniques that<br>
                        allow them to focus attention, emphasize information, foreshadow and produce the<br>
                        many elements that together comprise a well-told story.<br>
                        With this workshop, we’ll revisit the topic of using stories in design and expand on the<br>
                        technical aspects used in film to communicate. We’ll look at some tools used in film,<br>
                        such as cinematic patterns, beat sheets, and storyboards. We’ll consider why they’re<br>
                        used and how we might look to them for inspiration.

                        Static wireframes are a drag on the whole design process. Prototyping makes things a<br>

                    <P class="presentation-1">
                        Dick Fosbury is an American track and field athlete who challenged the conventional<br>
                        approach to the high jump with an unorthodox “back first” technique that became<br>
                        known as the Fosbury Flop. His innovative approach to a sport that seemed to have<br>
                        reached its limits was ridiculed at first, with sportswriters labeling him “the world’s<br>
                        laziest high jumper” — but today variations of the Fosbury Flop are used by almost<br>
                        every high jumper.<br>
                        We need to challenge conventions, too. Many of the design conventions used in web,<br>
                        mobile and device interfaces have evolved from systems and processes that no longer<br>
                        connect with our audiences’ realities: a floppy disk as a metaphor to “save” information,<br>
                        push buttons as control devices and typography standards derived from mechanical<br>
                        typesetting.<br>
                        As designers and strategists, we need to think like Dick Fosbury, to deconstruct<br>
                        analogues, and to free ourselves from outdated ideas so that we can develop the new<br>
                        interfaces and interactions of the future.

                    <P class="presentation-1">
                        Play isn’t just for kids and heavy gamers. Anyone with a Foursquare account knows that<br>
                        – and the stickiness of a badge and a leaderboard. But a good, playful user experience<br>
                        isn’t about those surface elements either – it’s about creating an environment with<br>
                        well-understood rules, meaningful objectives, and a sense of fun. Whether you’re trying<br>
                        to encourage people – or yourself – to save money or to lose weight, a focus on game<br>
                        mechanics and play could be the trump card you’re looking for.

                        beats! You’ll learn basic JavaScript and CSS, plus beginner’s heavy metal drum patterns.<br>

                        to bring the audience to an emotional place. This helps make the user experience<br>

                        That first client meeting may not feel as warm and fulfilling as the first time you hold<br>
                        your newborn child, but consider the similarities.<br>
                        You know each other but have never met. As the relationship grows you will have to rely<br>
                        on your experiences and education to gently guide them while allowing flexibility for<br>
                        projects to change and evolve. It’s not your job to control everything, but if you are<br>

                    <P class="presentation-1">
                        We’ve reached a point where non-designers understand the value of design. This has
                        led to an increase in demand for design talent. In the past, we would have turned to
                        institutions of higher education to help us find new talent; however, today’s graduates
                        often finish school without the skills they need to thrive in a professional design setting.
                        There is a massive gap between what students learn and what industry needs. This skills
                        gap leaves graduates unable to find jobs and hiring companies unable to find talent.
                        How we approach this challenge will affect the continued relevance and value of design.

                        By now, you’ve probably heard of “flexbox,” short for the CSS Flexible Box Layout<br>
                        module and the most fully developed and well supported of CSS3’s wide array of new<br>
                        layout mechanisms. Flexbox allows you to create fluid, responsive layouts without<br>
                        having to worry about all those pesky float layout quirks we’ve dealt with for over a<br>
                        decade. But with cross-browser support still incomplete, you’ve probably relegated<br>
                        flexbox to the “one day” pile of web design tricks.<br>
                        It’s time to stop waiting. In this talk, Zoe aims to convince you that it’s a good idea to<br>
                        start learning and using flexbox today. You’ll learn how to take your designs—and web<br>
                        design skills—to the next level as we use flexbox as practical progressive enhancement,<br>
                        adding it in bits and pieces on individual page components with graceful fallbacks.
