                    <h4 class="description">DESIGNING A CULTURE OF DESIGN</h4>
                    <P class="presentation-1">
                        Workplace culture doesn’t start with beanbags, foosball tables, or a beer fridge, and it<br>
                        doesn’t end with neckties, PCs, or big corporations. It’s the unwritten rules, behavior,<br>
                        beliefs, and the motivations that enable good work to get done, or it’s what stifles a<br>
                        workforce. For design to be most effective and for designers to feel valued, we need to<br>
                        work in a culture that embraces design and allows it to succeed.<br>
                        In Aaron’s session he will explore how to recognize the traits of organizations that *get*<br>
                        design, both large and small. He will share what those teams, departments, and<br>
                        companies have that others don’t, and more importantly, how to begin to change your<br>
                        own workplace’s culture. Once you’ve worked within a culture of design it’s almost<br>
                        impossible to imagine yourself anywhere else.

                <P class="presentation-1">
                    Films succeed in evoking responses and engaging audiences only with a combination of<br> 
                    well-written narrative and effective storytelling technique. It’s the filmmaker’s job to<br> 
                    put this together. To do so they’ve developed processes, tools and techniques that<br> 
                    allow them to focus attention, emphasize information, foreshadow and produce the<br> 
                    many elements that together comprise a well-told story.<br>
                    With this workshop, we’ll revisit the topic of using stories in design and expand on the<br> 
                    technical aspects used in film to communicate. We’ll look at some tools used in film,<br> 
                    such as cinematic patterns, beat sheets, and storyboards. We’ll consider why they’re<br> 
                    used and how we might look to them for inspiration.

                <p class="presentation-1">
                Adam Connor is a designer, illustrator and speaker passionate about collaboration,<br> 
                communication, creativity and storytelling. As an Experience Design Director with<br> 
                Mad*Pow, Adam combines 10+ years of experience in interaction and experience<br> 
                design with a background in computer science, film, and animation to create effective<br> 
                and easy-to-use digital products and services. He believes that no matter how<br> 
                utilitarian a tool is, at the core of its creation lies a story; uncovering that story is key to<br> 
                its success. Occasionally, he shares his perspectives on design at adamconnor.com and<br>
